# line_fitting
A lot of shit code to fit lines

Here there are some routines I wrote to fit multi gaussians emission lines.
They work, but there is probably reduntant code and everything can be a lot improved.

next step:

1) Rewrite everything using astropy fitting libraries
2) reduce the amount of redundant code
3) adapt it to more cases
4) create a GUI that can help with the fitting
